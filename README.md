# Toxic-Comment-Classifier

<p>Our goal is to classify tweets into six different categories, toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate. Our project analyzed a dataset CSV file from Kaggle containing 31,935 tweets. The dataset was heavily skewed with 93% of tweets or 29,695 tweets containing non-hate labeled Twitter data and 7% or 2,240 tweets containing hate-labeled Twitter data.</p>
